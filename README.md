# LoLUpdater v1.1.1 for OS X
## How to use
[Download](https://github.com/davidkna/LoLUpdater/archive/master.zip) and run `LoLUpdater.command`, if you want to revert the changes run `Restore.command`. I suggest to close LoL before starting the patch. The script will require your password.
## If you haven't installed LoL at default location...
If you haven't installed LoL at `/Applications/League of Legends.app`, place it in the Applicaiton root to run. Google if you don't know how to get there. Backups are stored there as well.
## What does it do?
LoLUpdater will update the internal depencies Nvidia Cg, Adobe Air and Bugsplat (bug reporter). This will improve performance for you and in case you want to revert the changes the script creates backups of the old files.
## Other recommendations
Download a Windows font pack. Your eyes will thank you.
